# Drawing-insights-from-Stack-Overflow-Annual-Developer-Survey

## Description
This project is the first project from the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. 
This was my first ever Data Science/Machine Learning Project. Unfortunately, my predictive model was not performing as well as I would like it to be. 
I am super excited to learn more about Machine Learning and improve the performance of my future models.

## File Description
**Stack Overflow Machine Learning Exercise.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook file of the data analysis

## Summary:
With insights drawn from the 2024 Stack Overflow developer survey, looking at specifically developers from the United States of America. Most of developers who filled out the survey worked at large companies. Large companies also tend to compensate their developers more compared to other size companies. 

## Installation
The libraries I used are: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn's metrics, scikit-learn's model selection, and scikit-learn's ensemble
