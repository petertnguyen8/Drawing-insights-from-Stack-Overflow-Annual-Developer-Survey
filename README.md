# Drawing-insights-from-Stack-Overflow-Annual-Developer-Survey

## Description
This project is the first project from the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree. 
This was my first ever Data Science/Machine Learning Project. Unfortunately, my predictive model was not performing as well as I would like it to be. 
I am super excited to learn more about Machine Learning and improve the performance of my future models.

## Installation
The libraries I used are: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn's metrics, scikit-learn's model selection, and scikit-learn's ensemble

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to Udacity for guiding me through this project. 
Also to Stack Overflow for gathering and providing this dataset for developers like me to use.
